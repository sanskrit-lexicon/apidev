This version of the list display uses an iframe (api_listview.php).
One advantage is that this iframe may be used in other displays.
The idea was suggested in email conversations with Ralph Bunker.

php now has a built-in dev server.
usage:  
(a) open a terminal window (cmd.exe or the GitBash terminal)
(b) cd to the 'home' directory, e.g.
 cd c:\sanlex
(c) Start up php on port 8000:
php -S localhost:8000

(d) Now, in a browser, the url localhost:8000/ serves pages from the
  home directory, e.g.localhost:8000/index.php serves the page 
  c:\sanlex\index.php
(e) Note that all http requests are mirrored in the terminal window
(f) To close the web server, bring the terminal window into focus and
  type CTRL-c
